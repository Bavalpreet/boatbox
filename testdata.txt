Firstly the 28'6\" is actually 31 feet with the bracket. My beam is also 9\"5\". My deadrise is 24 degrees. The amount of hull in the actual water is much more than 25 contender-thus more drag. As said...I do get 2.1 - 2.2 MPG in the intracoastal waterway with 1/2 tank fuel. But in normal sea conditions am luck to average 1.8 or 1.9 unless it's real flat. If you put those EFI's on my boat, they would burn 20-25% more fuel at cruise and probably 40% more at wide open and at trolling speed. The 200 HPDI's come very close to the 200 four's (I spoke to yamaha tech on this one) At cruise there is about 10 percent difference in economy, more at faster speeds in favor of the F200's. FYI-My neighbor has the 25 contender with 200 HPDI's and he cruises at 40 MPH burning about 19-20 GPH or even less in very flat conditions. hold 337 gallons of fuel with all tanks full (I added the extra wing tanks) and think gas weighs about 6 pounds per gallon so thats about 2000 pounds of fuel when am full. The fours are not miracle machines but they have many advantages as have listed above in my 1st post on this thread.

The plastic liner on the inside of the hoses separate and start to restrict flow by jamming up inside, just an idea. Also another thing is to use 2 micron fuel/h2o filter in place of the standard 10 micron. But if you said there was crud inside the tank it had to come from something inside there correct? On top of the fuel pump there is rubber o-ring that provides the seal when you push the pump up inside to seat.
